complaint 

Water supply

I am writing to report that the water supply to my flat has been completely 
stopped since today morning. This issue is causing significant inconvenience 
to my daily routine. I kindly request you to resolve this problem at the earliest. 
Please keep me informed about the progress or any necessary steps from my end.
